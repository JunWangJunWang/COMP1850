<p>I plan to create a website for my big family. We locates in different countries. We always have lots of information to share with each. Some are in big sized so they are not easy to transfer with chat programs or emails. This website should have following characteristics and content:

<table>
<tr> 
	<th> Characteristics</th>
	<th> Centent</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<ul>
	<li> Hierarchical organization style dominates;</li>
	<li> Accessibility works for wide age ranged audience ;</li>
	<li> Content is organized based on family tree; </li>
	<li> Color scheme reflects the family member's personality; </li>
	<li> Server is large and fast enough for high resolution photos and videos; <li>

</tr>
