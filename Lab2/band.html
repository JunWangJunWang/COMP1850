<h1> Stream of Praise </h1>

<a href="http://www.sop.org/en/about/"> <strong> Stream of Praise </strong> (SOP) </a> is one of my favourite groups. They are a band but more like a music team for Christian ministry. They were established in 1993 as a non-profit organization in California. The main singers are:

<dt>The Path of Grace </dt>
<dd> <a href=http://www.sop.org/en/releases/sa-01-pathofgrace/> This </a> is a instrumental album, including the 12 most popular songs in the previous published but this time in strings. You will experience those old touching songs in a different way. </dd>

<dt>Glory</dt>
<dd> From Now till Evermore is the most powerful song in <a href=http://www.sop.org/en/releases/pw-19-glory/> this 14-song album</a>. This is one of the releases in 2014. It belong to Praise and Worship Genres. From the quick speeded Glory to slow Emmanuel, each song tell a different story, either cheering you up or leading you a quite calm status. It is a new but pretty good release.
