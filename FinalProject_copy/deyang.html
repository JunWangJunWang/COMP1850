			<P>Deyang was not the place when I grew up. In fact, I lived in a small town close to Deyang with my parents. However, after my sister graduated from university, she works at Dayang. It becomes more and more familiar to me especailly after my parents moved there after they retired at the small town.
		<br>
			<p>Deyang locates northeast Chengdu, captial of Sichuan province. It is famous for a few high-tech heavy machinery companies there. It has around 4 million people and area of 2 thousands square miles.
		<br>		
			<P>Deyang is also well known by a alcohol brand Jiananchun and Sanxingdui museum. It is about the ancient bronze mask.
