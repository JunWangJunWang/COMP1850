	My sister is a quiet person. She was good at Arts while I was good at Science in school. She was detail-oriented and considerate while I at most time was opposite to her. After she graduated with Chinese Medicine major, she started working at a medicine administration office. She never moved to any other place. In fact, her professional and patient personality brings her to achieve great achievements. She also has a daughter, tall and pretty, like her mom. My brother-in-law, also works at a medical related area. A little like my parents, both of them have similar major.
