	My parents were working together in a clinic. My father was a doctor while my mother was a nurse. They always had many topics to share with each other because of the similar major on medicine. Other than that, my father is very handy man. I remember from our clothing to our furnitures, many home use stuff were made by himself. My mother knows how to make a home clean and comfortable.
