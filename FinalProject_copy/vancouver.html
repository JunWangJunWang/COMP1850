			<P>Vancouver was the first place when we immigrated to Canada. In fact, it was not the place for me to settle down when I planned the immigration. Instead, Toronto was my target. However, when we spent one month here for a summer vacation, the stunning views, friendly communities as well as the good weather made us to change the plan. Even the limited professional job openings increased the challenges for both I and my husband, we have never regretted this decision.
			<P>Vancouver locates west of Canada, Pacific Coast in southwestern British Columbia. Vancouver is known as one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Bordered by the Pacific Ocean, the Fraser River, the Burrard Inlet, and the Coast Mountains to the east, the city is surrounded by shimmering waters and towering trees. 
			<P>There are 8 cities in the Greater Vancouver which occupies around 2.4 million inhabitant. It is the third most populous metropolitan area Canada. Over half of the residents have a first language other than English. It is multicultural and friendly to visible minority.
