<p>I am not a quiet person, enjoying outside activities, such as travelling, dancing, photographing and reading. Also I like indoor decorations and so spend time to make my rooms clean and pretty.</p>
<ol>
<li><h2> Travelling </h2> </li>
<p> My first big trip in the US happened after I had the 1st job at Vancouver. My husband and I with my 12-years daughter went to <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/" Disneyland <strong> Disneyland </strong> </a>! We fled to LA and drove to Anaheim, California. We also visited quite a few other cities, and 2 weeks later, we flew back from SanFrancesco. We have had lots of good memories. Except for Disneyland, the other two top theme parks I was impressed most are: </p>
<ul type="square">
<li> <a href="http://seaworldparks.com/en/seaworld-sandiego/"> Seaworld San Diego theme park </a> </li>
<li> <a href= "http://www.universalstudios.com/"> Universal Studios </a> </li>
</ul>

<li><h2> Planting </h2> </li>
<p> I like green colour that might be one of reasons why travelling which bring me to green nature is so attractive to me. At home, this color always calm me in a quiet way. I have had the various types of plants at home either outdoor or indoor, from jasmine to asparagus. I not only enjoy their growth but also happy with my workload and outcome by taking care of them.</p>
<li><h2> Dancing </h2> </li>
For following reasons, I like dancing too:

<li>Exercises</li>
	<p>It is a good opportunity to trench your body and do the activities you might never do if you don't dance.</p>
<li>Happiness</li>
	<p>It is a combination of physical strength and spiritual involvement. The whole process releases me from work, worries and other negative emotion.</p>
</ul>
	
<li><h2> Photographing</h2> </li>
<p>Successfully capturing the pretty moments of either people or nature normally bring me a lots joy. Sharing those pictures with friends or sometime just looking at them make me stratified too.</P>
