			<P> When two people face to face, if they want, they communicate with words,  body languages and  face expressions. They understand each other quickly.

			<p> But how to those with unreachable distance?
			<p> That was over 10 years ago, one summer day, hot, no rain but wet in air. At the airport of Chengdu, China, I with my husband and 7-year old daughter, said goodbye to my big family and a few of friends. In fact, my parents didn't show up. They preferred not to experience the departure at airport. On that summer day,  hot, no rain but wet in air, I felt I would shortly come back this city in which I had spent my first 30 years. But I had never imagined, when I went back, it was only for a short visit, and it was after 5 years later.
			<p> During the days we were in Vancouver, Canada, my big family was in China with almost 10 thousands of kilometers' space. Mails are too slow, so emails and phone calls became the main channel to tell how we were going. For this reason, my mom over 60 years old started to learn computer. The worries drove her to learn typing Chinese. She picked up so quickly and so was called e-times' grandma by her grandchildren.
			<p> Now a popular massager smartphone tool WeChat dominates our communication. We can talk, leave messages or sometime video chat. However, transferring large files, pictures and videos become time-consuming and impossible sometime. So I was thinking a website might help. We can share our news, especially high quality pictures and videos much easier. It is not only faster than WeChat but also it only lead upload once and then everybody can see and download.
			<p> This web is designed to share our info among our family members and close friends.
