<p>I am not a quiet person, enjoying outside activities, such as travelling, dancing, photographing and reading. Also I like indoor decorations and so spend time to make my rooms clean and pretty.In fact, photographing and cooking are common hobbies.

	<li style="font-size:1em; font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; padding-top:30px;">Cooking</li><br>
	Cooking is one of the favorite activities in our big family. My good memory with childhood and a warm home always connect with some meals, yes, good meals. When my parents lived with us, I and my husband released from cooking after work. When I open the door, seeing my parents in the kitchen, I know I am home. Not only myself, in fact, our whole big family like cookies, so sometime we share the recipes which we modified after we try. <a href="cooking.html">Click here</a> to know more. <br>
	
	<li style="font-size:1em; font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; padding-top:30px;">Travelling  </li> <br>
			My first big trip in the US happened after I had the 1st job at Vancouver. My husband and I with my 12-years daughter went to <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/"> Disneyland </a>! We fled to LA and drove to Anaheim, California. We also visited quite a few other cities, and 2 weeks later, we flew back from SanFrancesco. We have had lots of good memories. Except for Disneyland, the other two top theme parks I was impressed most are: <a href="http://seaworldparks.com/en/seaworld-sandiego/"> Seaworld San Diego theme park </a>and<a href= "http://www.universalstudios.com/"> Universal Studios!</a> 
				
	<li style="font-size:1em; font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; padding-top:30px;">Planting  </li><br>
			 I like green colour that might be one of reasons why travelling which bring me to green nature is so attractive to me. At home, this color always calm me in a quiet way. I have had the various types of plants at home either outdoor or indoor, from jasmine to asparagus. I not only enjoy their growth but also happy with my workload and outcome by taking care of them.	
	<li style="font-size:1em; font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; padding-top:30px;">Dancing  </li><br>
			For following reasons, I like dancing.It is a good opportunity to make your body released after a workout. You will stretch your body and make some postures you might never do if you don't dance. Also it is a combination of physical strength and spiritual involvement. The whole process releases me from work, worries and other negative emotion.
					
	<li style="font-size:1em; font-weight:bold;font-style:italic; padding-top:30px;">Photographing </li> <br>
		Successfully capturing the pretty moments of either people or nature normally bring me a lots joy. Sharing those pictures with friends or sometime just looking at them make me stratified too.
