			<p>Deyang locates northeast Chengdu, captial of Sichuan province. It is famous for a few high-tech heavy machinery companies there. It has around 4 million people and area of 2 thousands square miles.
		<br>
			<P>I grew up in a small town in Sichuan. After the university, while I worked at Chengud, my sister started her career and family at Deyang, a county near to Chengdutives live. Since that, I visited there very frequently, and soon it became more and more familiar to me especailly after my parents moved there after both of them retired.
		<br>		
			<P>Deyang is also well known  because of a very good alcohol brand Jiananchun. The Sanxingdui museum, ancient bronze mask, attracts thousands of tourists every year.
