<p> Our great family, in total 8 members, we have different hobbies. I was enjoying collecting stamps but stopped after moving to Canada. I immersed in the challenges from the totally new place, but very soon, I found a good way to release myself. I with my family visited parks, from the biggest city park in North America---Stanley Park to the tiny neighbourhood playground. We found joys and experienced surprises by those stunning scenes. 
<p> To comfort my great family members in China after our departure, we took digital pictures as many as we could and shared with them through internet. In the same time, to build a convenient and cheap communication channel, my Mom started to learn computer at her old ages. My Dad started to learn photographing in a school for seniors. 
<p> Looking back after over 10 years after moving here, not only the track of my small family was changed but also the style of my great family was hugely impacted by my small family...... Tears and laughters, more or less, were recorded by cameras. 
<p> Now photographing became the common hobby to all of us.
