			<P>What is a home to us? What makes a place with facilites and people different from one to other? Is it the size of this physical place? Is it the size or style of this place? No, all not. The key to make a place qualified to be home not a hotel, is not physical facilities but the people inside!
			<p> My family is a medium sized family. My parents have me and my elder sister with 3 years gap. Since I can remember something, we lived at a very small town in Sichuan Province, China. Because it was small, everywhere and most of people there to me were so familiar with. This brought me a safety feeling. Like the word of "home", it always brings me comfort and safe feeling. 
			<p>In my memory, she was quite and shy but I was aloud and brave. At most of time, I was the trouble maker while she was the one making my parents happy... I have an elder sister and she with her family in China with my parents when my parents live in China. She has a daughter like my child is a girl too.</p>
